# Advanced Regression Case Study for Car Price Prediction
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Advanced Regression techniques. We will be understanding and solving an Car Price Prediction problem in Automobile Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like car price prediction system.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Advanced Regression Techniques for Car Price Prediction.

- What is the background of your project?

We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

- Business Problem Statement:

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market.
- What is the dataset that is being used?

We got the dataset from Kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction

## Conclusions
- To summarise, we have performed a advanced regression and have covered some basic introductory statistics as well. This is by no means a comprehensive analysis of the marketing data set but simply an example of how to perform and interpret an advanced regression with Python. Itâ€™s a good starting point, especially when attempting to understand the relevance of important statistical concepts like t-statistic, p-value and standard error. We also performed Ridge and Lasso Regression for Car Price Prediction Problem.
